# This years puzzles

### Day 01
summing sets of ints, finding the set with largest sum

### Day 02
rock paper scissors

### Day 03
alphabet, find common letters in strings

### Day 04
find overlapping ranges

### Day 05
complicated input parsing. Moving items between stacks.

### Day 06
Finding the first sequence of x unique letters in a string

### Day 07
Deducting the contents of a file system according to terminal logs. Nested dirs and recursion.

### Day 08
Grid traversal. What trees have no higher neighbours in any direction?

### Day 09
Dragging a rope in multiple directions and tracking its tail.

### Day 10
Run multi cycle instructions across clock ticks, then draw letters.

### Day 11
Optimizing for many loops. Reducing numbers that are too big.

To make the number smaller, take the product of all numbers it needs to be modulo'd by, and modulo it by that product.
This leaves a remainder which conserves enough information about the number, whilst being smaller.

### Day 12
Breadth First Search (BFS) through a grid filled with heigh levels. Climb a mountain one level at a time.

### Day 13
Comparing nested lists to specific sorting rules, then use those comparisons to sort them.

### Day 14
Simulating the gravity of grains of sand falling onto a pile.

### Day 18
A three-dimensional grid, with the objective to count uncovered walls and hollow spaces within the sphere.
