# Advent of Code

This is my collection of code for past events of Advent of Code. Currently participating in the 2021 event, using python.

> "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like." (https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)

If you enjoy the Advent of Code please consider donating to keep the project running.
