# Advent of Code 2021

This folder contains all my code and inputs for the 2021 challenges. I'm using python 3.

My personal goals for this year's event are
- solving more puzzles than last year (35)
- documenting my code with a short explanation of the algorithm for every script
- revamping my python knowledge, since I have barely touched python the past months, and I would like to get back into it
- trying out new packages and libraries that would be useful for AoC this year
